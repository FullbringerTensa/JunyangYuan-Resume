        <p class="lead mb-4">	I am a first year freshman at UCR, currently taking the CS008 class that teaches the students about how websites are created, and how to use tools such as excel and word docs in a proficient way. Some hobbies I have and got into are reading web novels and playing video games. I enjoy playing video games such as League of Legends, Valorant, Counter Strike 2, Overwatch, and Minecraft because it helps me with my boredom and allows me to have fun with my friends and also meet new people. During my experience, I have made several friends that I have known for around 4-5 years from games to today. I enjoy reading web novels because they provide me with a storyline and characters that brings me not just amusement but joy. Some people think that web novels are all boring because they are just filled with lines of words. However, I do not believe so because people are able to make use of their imagination when they are reading web novels and at the sametime improving their writing skills.
